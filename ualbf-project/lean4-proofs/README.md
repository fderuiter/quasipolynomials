# UALBF Lean 4 Proof Library

Welcome to the Lean 4 formalized proof component of the Universal Arithmetic Lower Bound Framework (UALBF). 

This sub-project is designed to provide complete, machine-checked mathematical verification for the bounds and theorems used by the high-performance Rust engine. The purpose of this library is to guarantee that the mathematical constraints and pruning heuristics hardcoded into the computational search (such as the Prasad-Sunitha abundancy bounds and Legendre-Cattaneo obstructions) have rigorous foundational proofs.

## Architectural Overview

The Lean 4 project is structured in a **Four-Layer Architecture** strictly separating foundational logic from engine-specific computational wrappers. 

This strict separation ensures that purely mathematical theorems (`Pure` layer) do not depend on the specific hypotheses of Quasiperfect Numbers (`QPN` layer), and that the Rust engine's runtime checks (`Engine` and `FFI` layers) are directly backed by verified bounds.

## Directory and File Structure

Below is a comprehensive, file-by-file breakdown of the directory structure and the logical systems contained within each file.

### Root Files

- **`UALBF.lean`**
  The root import file for the entire Lean 4 proof library. This file simply sequentially imports the four foundational layers (`Basic`, `Pure`, `QPN`, and `Engine`/`FFI`). It ensures that when the Rust engine's `build.rs` compiles the library, all mathematical dependencies are statically verified.

- **`UALBF/Basic.lean` (Layer 0)**
  Contains foundational definitions shared universally across all lower layers. Here, you will find the definitions for the arithmetic sum-of-divisors function `sigma`, the core predicate `IsQuasiperfect`, the `abundancy_index` formulation, `ExactValuation`, and the `Bipartition` structure which defines how the search space is mathematically split.

- **`UALBF/FFI.lean`**
  Computational wrappers bridging Lean 4's verified logic to the C-Foreign Function Interface (FFI). Because Lean erases pure `Prop` proofs at runtime, this file provides executable boolean `def`s (tagged with `@[export]`) that mirror the proven theorems. These definitions compile into the static library invoked directly by the Rust execution threads.

### Layer 1: Pure (`UALBF/Pure/`)
*Mathematical foundations independent of Quasiperfect Numbers. All proofs in this folder are "purely" structural and upstreamable, meaning they do not rely on the `IsQuasiperfect N` hypothesis.*

- **`Arithmetic.lean`**
  Generic helpers and foundational lemmas handling parity, elementary modular arithmetic, and prime factorization properties. Serves as the bedrock for the more complex algebraic proofs upstream.

- **`EulerProduct.lean`**
  Provides the algebraic decomposition of the Euler totient ratio ($N / \phi(N)$) into an abundancy index multiplied by a correction factor product. 

- **`RationalBounds.lean`**
  A structural toolkit for evaluating strict bounds on rational functions and infinite series over primes. Used heavily to formalize constraints on prime abundancies.

- **`Cyclotomic.lean`**
  The core machinery for cyclotomic polynomials. Contains evaluation bounds, characterization of primitive roots, GCD structure, and the vital Lifting-the-Exponent (LTE) lemma which is crucial for proving prime factor presence.

- **`CyclotomicAlgebra.lean`**
  Provides auxiliary and inductive sub-lemmas bounding specific algebraic expansions required by the broader cyclotomic theory.
  
- **`Zsigmondy.lean`**
  The formalization of the classical Zsigmondy's Theorem. This file elegantly combines the cyclotomic machinery to formally prove the existence of primitive prime divisors for the expression $p^n - 1$. 

---

### Layer 2: QPN (`UALBF/QPN/`)
*Domain-specific proofs modeling Quasiperfect Numbers. Every theorem in this folder requires the `h : IsQuasiperfect N` hypothesis.*

- **`BasicProperties.lean`**
  Proves essential attributes that any Quasiperfect number must possess. Crucially, it proves that $\sigma(N)$ is odd, that QPNs must be perfect squares (specifically, odd perfect squares), and mathematically forbids QPNs from being double squares.

- **`Obstruction.lean`**
  Formalizes the **Universal Modulo-8 Obstruction** (Legendre-Cattaneo Filter). It proves that if $q$ is an odd prime factor of $\sigma(N)$ for a quasiperfect $N$, then $q \equiv 1$ or $3 \pmod 8$. 


- **`PrasadSunitha.lean`**
  An extensive proof establishing the Prasad-Sunitha bound, specifically establishing that any QPN un-divisible by 3 and 5 ($\gcd(N, 15) = 1$) must possess a minimum of $\omega(N) \ge 15$ distinct prime factors.

- **`AbundancyBound.lean`**
  Integrates the generalized Rational Bounds with the specific QPN hypothesis, cementing the cross-multiplied abundancy upper and lower bounds utilized throughout the paper's theory.

---

### Layer 3: Engine Verification (`UALBF/Engine/`)
*Contains the formal soundness proofs for the real-time search logic utilized within the Rust engine.*

- **`Bipartition.lean`**
  Formalizes the Prefix-Suffix bipartition theorems utilized by the Rust backend's depth-first search. Proves the multiplicativity of the Sigma function over the bipartition space, formally validating that because left ($N_L$) and right ($N_R$) sub-trees are coprime, $\sigma(N_L \cdot N_R) = \sigma(N_L) \cdot \sigma(N_R)$.

- **`SieveSoundness.lean`**
  Provides exact valuation theorems that formally prove the Rust engine's valuation sieve (which discards sub-topologies using divisibility invariants) is mathematically sound. It guarantees that the computational engine mathematically cannot miss a valid QPN.
